        India, located in South Asia, is the seventh-largest country by land
        area and the most populous nation in the world. Known for its rich
        cultural heritage, diverse languages, and historical landmarks, India is
        a land of remarkable contrasts and traditions. It is home to various
        religions including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism,
        and Jainism. India gained independence from British rule in 1947 and has
        since developed into the world's largest democracy. The country boasts a
        rapidly growing economy, a vibrant film industry (Bollywood), and a
        strong presence in science and technology. From the Himalayan peaks in
        the north to the tropical beaches in the south, India's geographical
        diversity is as vast as its cultural landscape.
